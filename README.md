> A custom node class for shaking and moving the window for Godot 4.2x. 

Have you ever seen those '4th Wall Breaking' Games, that does a lot of crazy stuff, *including moving your **game window??!?***

And ~~sometimes~~ **MOST OF THE TIME**, adding these stuff is a time-waste.

So, meet **GD-GodMode**, your all-in-one swiss-army-knife for anything 4th Wall Breaking! This basically makes your entity *'feel'* like a God... or atleast, feels as if it has control over your PC.

Do **WHATEVER** you want with this; add your own stuff (I'll try including it on the main too ğŸ˜‰), just make sure whatever you do is safe for the player, and **DO NOT UTELIZE IT AS A DANGEROUS WEAPON.**

## TODO
- [] Add a function for Window-Shaking (make it more easy, add some parameters)
- [] Add a move window and lerp move window function.
- [] Add a change size function
- [] Add some get functions on 'personal' stuff (like USERNAME, NOTHING DANGEROUS ğŸ’€)

> **!!! Currently WORK-IN-PROGRESS !!! Please be patient ğŸ¤Œ**
