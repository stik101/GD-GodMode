Have you ever seen those '4th Wall Breaking' Games, that does a lot of crazy stuff, *including moving your game window??!?*

And ~~sometimes~~ **MOST OF THE TIME**, including this is a time-waste.

So, meet GD-GodMode, your all-in-one swiss-army-knife for anything 4th Wall Breaking! This basically makes your entity 'feel' like a God... or atleast, feels as if it has control over your PC.

Do WHATEVER you want with this; add your own stuff (I'll try including it on the main too 😉), just make sure whatever you do is safe for the player, and DO NOT UTELIZE IT AS A DANGEROUS WEAPON.

**!!! Currently WORK-IN-PROGRESS !!! Please be patient 🤌**
